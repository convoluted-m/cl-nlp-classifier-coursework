# cl-nlp-classifier-coursework

## Overview

This repository contains the code written for the LELA60331 coursework and documents the implemention of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) classifier for sentiment analysis. The code as well as the data required for running the model are included in the  `sentiment-classifier.ipynb` jupter notebook file.
 
## Requirements

 * JupyterLab/Colab
 * Python 3.11
 * Numpy, Matplotlib

## Running the code

Open `sentiment-classifier.ipynb` in Google Colab or JupyterLab with a kernel version of `3.11` - run each cell sequentially, following the code annotaions as guidance.
